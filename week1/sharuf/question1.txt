par1:-
in the first part we get the output as ['1','S','T','E'] and ['1','S','T','E']
because the list1=list2 part in the code creates the same object for both of them so change in list2 also create a 
change in list1 but in the next part we wrote list1=list1+[] will create new object for list1 so after that change 
in list2  doesnt create a change in list1
part2:-
the second output is ['1','S','T','E'] and ['1','2','T','E']
here for the first output the reason is same as mentioned in the above case for the 2 nd output here the list1+=[]
will not create a new object for list1 hence change in the value of list2 changes the value of list1
